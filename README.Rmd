**This package replaces the [strings](https://github.com/Centre-for-Marine-Applied-Research/strings) package.** 

New features:

- Cleaner code 
- More straightforward workflow 
  - don't need to export intermediate "raw" and "trim" files
  - few arguments to specify in templates
- Additional functions (e.g., `ss_download_data()`)
- Variable names consistent with [Climate Forecast](https://cfconventions.org/) conventions
- Formal tests
- More helpful `Error` and `Warning` messages


Compile, format, and visualize Water Quality (temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity) data measured by different sensors. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `sensorstrings` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dempsey-CMAR/sensorstrings")
```

## Package Structure

The function at the tip calls the function at the tail.

## Background

The Centre for Marine Applied Research ([CMAR](https://cmar.ca/)) coordinates an extensive [Coastal Monitoring Program](https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/) to measure [Essential Ocean Variables](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14&Itemid=114) from around the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. There are three main branches of the program: _Water Quality_, _Currents_, and _Waves_. Processed data for each branch can be viewed and downloaded from several sources, as outlined in the [CMAR Report & Data Access Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/Centre-for-Marine-Applied-Research/strings/blob/master/man/figures/README-access-cheatsheet.pdf) (download for clickable links).

The `sensorstrings` package is the backbone of the data pipeline for the _Water Quality_ branch of the Coastal Monitoring Program. It is used to organize, compile, format, and visualize data _Water Quality_ data. 

_Water Quality_ data (temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity) is collected using “sensor strings”. Each sensor string is attached to the seafloor by an anchor and suspended by a sub-surface buoy, with autonomous sensors attached at various depths (Figure 1). A string typically includes three sensor models: Hobo, aquaMeasure, and VR2AR (Table 1). Strings are deployed at a station for several months and data are measured every 1 minute to 1 hour, depending on the sensor.

After retrieval, data from each sensor is exported to a separate csv file using manufacturer-specific software. Each type of sensor generates a data file with unique columns and header fields, which poses a significant challenge for compiling all data from a deployment into a single format for analysis.

The `sensorstrings` package offers functions to compile, format, convert units, and visualize sensor string data.

`sensorstrings` was developed specifically to streamline CMAR’s workflow, but is flexible enough that other users can apply it to process data from the accepted sensors (Table 1). **Vignettes to come**

```{r, echo=FALSE,caption= "Sensor Models included"}

tibble(
  SENSORS = c(
    "HOBO Pro V2", "HOBO DO",
    "aquaMeasure DOT", "aquaMeasure SAL",
    "VR2AR"
  ),
  urls = c(

    "Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen", "Temperature, Salinity", 
    "Temperature" )
) %>%

  select(Sensor, `Variable(s) Measured`) %>% 
  kable(align = "ll", format = "pipe")

## Example

```{r example}
library(sensorstrings)
```

Consider a string deployed from May 31, 2019 to October 19, 2019 with three sensors:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

tibble(
  "Sensor" = c("HOBO Pro V2", "aquaMeasure DOT", "VR2AR"),
  "Serial #" = c("10755220", "670364", "547109"),
  "Depth" = c("2", "5", "15")
) %>% 
kable(align = "lcc")

```

### Raw data files

The data from each sensor is saved in separate csv file, each with manufacturer-specific columns.

Import raw data files:

```{r}

path <- system.file("extdata", package = "sensorstrings")

aquameasure_raw <- ss_read_aquameasure_data(
  path = paste0(path, "/aquameasure"), 
  file_name = "aquameasure-670364.csv"
)

hobo_raw <- ss_read_hobo_data(
  path = paste0(path, "/hobo"), 
  file_name = "10755220.csv"
)

vemco_raw <- ss_read_vemco_data(
  path = paste0(path, "/vemco"), 
  file_name = "vemco-547109.csv"
)

```

Examine the first rows of each raw data file:

#### AquaMeasure data
```{r}
head(aquameasure_raw)
```

#### Hobo data

```{r}
head(hobo_raw)
```

#### Vemco data

```{r}
head(vemco_raw)
```


Data from each sensor is exported in a slightly different layout, making it difficult to work with and analyze all of the data from a single deployment.

### Compile and format with `sensorstrings`

The `ss_compile_deployment_data()` function makes it easy to compile these files into a single data frame, with additional information added from the deployment log.

#### Deployment Log

The deployment log includes the deployment and retrieval dates, information on where the string was deployed, and the depth of each sensor.
```{r}
log <- ss_read_log(path)
```

```{r}
log$deployment_dates
```

```{r}
log$area_info
```

```{r}
log$sn_table
```

#### Compile Data

`ss_compile_deployment_data()` reads in the log and the data for each sensor and exports a single data frame.
```{r}
dat <- ss_compile_deployment_data(path)

kable(dat[1:10, ])
```


### Plot

```{r fig1, out.width='100%', dpi=600}
ss_plot_variables_at_depth(dat)
```
